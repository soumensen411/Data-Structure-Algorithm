=== Basic Priority Queue Operations ===

After inserting elements:
Priority Queue (Data:Priority):
[40:8] [20:5] [50:3] [10:2] [30:1] 

Highest priority element: 40 (Priority: 8)

Dequeuing highest priority element...
Priority Queue (Data:Priority):
[20:5] [50:3] [10:2] [30:1] 
Size: 4
=== Hospital Emergency Room Simulation ===

Patients arriving:
Patient 101 - Urgent (Priority 5)
Patient 102 - Minor (Priority 1)
Patient 103 - CRITICAL (Priority 10)
Patient 104 - Urgent (Priority 5)
Patient 105 - Moderate (Priority 3)

Priority Queue (Data:Priority):
[103:10] [101:5] [104:5] [105:3] [102:1] 

Treating patients in priority order:
Treating Patient 103 (Priority: 10)
Treating Patient 101 (Priority: 5)
Treating Patient 104 (Priority: 5)
Treating Patient 105 (Priority: 3)
Treating Patient 102 (Priority: 1)


=== CPU Task Scheduling Simulation ===

Task 1 - Normal (Priority 3)
Task 2 - High (Priority 8)
Task 3 - Low (Priority 1)
Task 4 - CRITICAL (Priority 10)
Task 5 - Medium (Priority 5)

Priority Queue (Data:Priority):
[4:10] [2:8] [5:5] [1:3] [3:1] 

Executing tasks in priority order:
Executing Task 4 (Priority: 10)
Executing Task 2 (Priority: 8)
